# Use AAuth in a service

The current profile authenticates an Agent directly to a Resource. Your service
supplies issuer trust, HTTPS transport, admission policy and state. It has no
Person Server, delegated authorization, body digest verification or replay store.
Start with the README's library program, then run the framework example:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p aauth-rust-resource --example axum
```

It starts an axum service on a random loopback port, sends a signed request,
prints the verified identity and policy context, and shuts down. This demonstrates
the private HTTP hop behind a TLS proxy, using a configured external HTTPS
origin. For the certificate-verified TLS exchange, run `--example direct-identity`.
All framework/runtime dependencies belong to examples/tests, not the libraries.

## Adapt framework requests

The [axum adapter](crates/aauth-rust-resource/examples/framework/mod.rs) keeps
the received method, path/query and headers, reconstructs the absolute URI from
its configured external origin, and reads the actual body with a 1 KiB limit.
An oversized body gets 413 before verification. Any nonempty body within the
limit reaches the gate and is refused by this bodyless profile. Never verify an
empty placeholder while forwarding an unread body.

Terminate TLS before this private hop. Take the external origin from service
configuration; accept forwarded scheme/authority only through an explicitly
trusted proxy boundary. An arbitrary Host or Forwarded header is not configuration.
One Resource binds one exact authority/path. Construct one per protected route
and share an `Arc<AgentKeyResolver>`; this does not fetch keys once per route.
Path predicates and Resource discovery metadata are not supplied yet.

Covered header fields use RFC 9421 canonicalization: trim outer spaces/tabs and
combine field lines with `, `. Outer whitespace changes alone preserve a proof.
Interpret Authorization consistently, or reject forms your application does not
support; do not treat signed coverage as a guarantee of raw header byte equality.

Use `Decision::into_result()` to send refusals or run your handler. Success yields
`(VerifiedAgentToken, admitted_context)`; refusal yields a boxed HTTP response.
A boolean policy carries `()`; `Result<T, Deny>` carries `T`. For example,
a policy can verify an upstream token once and pass that verified value to the
handler. `BoxedAdmissionPolicy<T>` gives that closure a name in application state.
The `Granted` payload also exposes `token()` and `admitted()` and dereferences to
the caller token for existing claim inspection. The demo `into_response()` success
mapping writes `sub`; use the extraction helper for an application response.

## Trust and refresh

Choose trusted issuers before inspecting a token. Fetch their metadata and JWKS
over admitted, certificate-verified HTTPS with deadlines, response bounds and
DNS/redirect controls. Construct `AgentProviderKeys` from those documents and
share it through Arc, references or Box. Snapshots are immutable and Clone;
a host resolver can replace a snapshot atomically after refresh.

`UntrustedIssuer` is terminal (`invalid_key` on the wire): never follow or refresh
a foreign token-named issuer. `UnknownKey` means a missing kid on a trusted
issuer. Refresh that issuer's configured JWKS source subject to cache lifetime
and the pinned draft's fetch-rate floor, then retry verification at most once.
Keep ordinary cache expiry/refresh independent from that recovery path. The
library does not fetch, cache or retry network effects for you.
Missing or invalid metadata `jwks_uri` is terminal `InvalidDiscoveryMetadata`
(`invalid_key`), so it must not trigger unknown-key retry logic.

## Keep Agent credentials fresh

Retain the Agent and obtain a new token before expiry, using the same confirmation
public key. `agent.with_token(new_token)` reuses the existing private key without
exporting its seed; earlier Agent values remain usable for in-flight requests.
If enrollment changes the confirmation key, create a new Agent with that key.
No background enrollment or refresh loop runs inside the library.

`Agent::new` checks syntax and key binding; it does **not** authenticate the AP's
signature. `AgentToken::parse(...).unverified_claims()` can inspect refresh hints,
but those claims confer no authority. A client that has a trusted AP key resolver
can call `AgentToken::verify(&resolver, now)` itself. It uses the same Core
verification API as a Resource; there is no prohibition on client verification.

All local clocks are Unix seconds in 0..=8589934591 (through 2242). Contemporary
millisecond timestamps are refused at signing/preparation and AP issuance. Values
inside the range cannot reveal their units, so convert explicitly. AP issuance
also caps lifetime at 24 hours; verification of another issuer does not turn the
recommendation into a mandatory ceiling. Expiry has no leeway. Resource proof
and optional future-iat bounds are 60 seconds.
Resource `clock_skew` responses include Date using the verifier clock you passed.

## Rotation and discovery documents

**AP-KEY-ROLLOVER is an explicit gap.** The AP convenience API publishes only its
active signing key. It has no retained-key list, overlap schedule or automatic
retirement lifecycle. Replacing the AP does not remove keys from existing verifier
snapshots. Old tokens fail after a refresh replaces the snapshot with a JWKS
that omits their key; do not describe that as seamless rotation. A host supplying
its own multi-key JWKS can retain public keys for its outstanding tokens; the
resolver selects by kid and tests cover old/new verification and later removal.
The host owns retention, refresh and retirement policy. Go shares this AP gap.

`metadata()` supplies minimal issuer/JWKS-location bytes. A host can publish its
own metadata with the same exact issuer and admitted HTTPS JWKS URL, plus the
draft's branding/policy fields. No AP branding builder or Resource metadata API
is provided. Server identifiers have no port or path. In local deployments,
map those logical identities to admitted sockets while preserving HTTPS names,
SNI and certificate verification. Temporary loopback ports belong to that map,
not to the token's `iss`. JWKS endpoint URLs are distinct from server identifiers.

## Replay and application effects

**Identical signed bytes can be accepted twice within the validity window.**
The replay test demonstrates two policy calls for the same proof. Authentication
is not once-only delivery. For operations that change state, use an application
idempotency key and atomically record the result with the operation. If you also
need exact replay refusal, retain a key derived from the selected key identity
and proof bytes for the proof's accepted window, including allowed future skew.
Token `jti` identifies issuance, not one request; many requests reuse a token.
A freshness tuple that omits query/authorization may intentionally reject more
than exact replays, so choose that policy with your application's concurrency in mind.

Forwarded Agent-token bytes prove what their issuer signed. They do not prove
that the original caller authorized this service or this downstream operation:
Agent tokens have no Resource audience binding in this slice. Carrying the bytes
in a covered Authorization header prevents substitution in that request; it does
not create AAuth delegation. Person binding and protocol call chaining require
Person/auth tokens and the Person Server, which are not implemented here.
